plenigo offers a full-featured e-commerce SaaS platform for digital products such as text, video, audio.

== Description ==
= What do I get with plenigo? =

Basically plenigo includes all you need to run your paid content offer. No matter if your offer is a Video on Demand subscription or a pay-per-view live stream, a metered model for your digital news page or magazine. With plenigo you can run any offer you like, created just with a few mouse clicks. Don’t believe it? Just try our BASIC account, with € 0 monthly fee. 

= What are the basic features? =

The plenigo team aims to include all necessary functionality you need to create the best possible platform for paid content offers. This does include a user-friendly checkout process that does not derive your users but keeps them on your page. Currently six different payment methods are included and can be integrated just by clicking a checkbox. In the penigo backend you can easily create your offer and just add e.g. „Premium“ to the tag box while managing your posts - now you have created your offer. There is much more, please have a look at „features" below. 

= Pricing =

plenigo offers four different pricing plans starting with 0 € fix fee, so it is risk free to test. You can easily upgrade once your offer is established. If you what to start with even more features, just pick one.  

= What do I need? =

Beside your Wordpress account, your plenigo merchant account and the offer you created, you need to sign up with the payment method you would like to use, e.g. PayPal. Why do you have to sign up for your own account: This way you can be 100% sure nobody but you has access to your earnings. plenigo only handles transfer, access, clients etc. but never has access to the money you earn. Currently plenigo offers credit card payments, SEPA direct debit, PayPal, Sofortueberweisung and bill payments.

= General Section =

**Test Mode**
Use the test mode for testing the integration and production mode for real payments.

**Company ID**
The company id provided to you by the plenigo backend after registration of a company account.

**Company Private Key**
The company private key provided to you by the plenigo backend after registration of a company account.

**Notify non-JavaScript user**
If you are using metered views or using the plenigo user login users with deactivated JavaScript can get negative site impressions. In case of metered views deactivated JavaScript means there is no paywall at all for metered view article so the user can access them without limit. We recommend to enabled this setting.

**non-JavaScript overlay title**
Title that is shown to the user in the overlay that is shown to users with deactivated JavaScript.

**non-JavaScript overlay message**
Message that is shown to the user in the overlay that is shown to users with deactivated JavaScript.

**Google Analytics ID**
If you insert your Google Analytics ID here you will get events about the delivered curtains, etc.

= OAuth2 Login Section =

**Use OAuth2 Login**
This is the base decision about your usermanagement. If you decide to use plenigo as OAuth2 Login provider all users are managed by the plenigo plugin and shadow users are created in WordPress. This way all users already registered at plenigo can login without new registration. Also the users can use the same account for payments and for writing comments, etc.
After enabling this you also need to insert the plenigo widget into your page. 

**Enable Wordpress Login**
If you select plenigo as your authentication provider you can decide if users should still see the regular WordPress login link or only see the login button via plenigo. (The later is recommended.)

**Override WP Profile data**
Decide which system is the leading system. If you allow users to modify their data also within WordPress the user data can vary and you won't get the latests data from the plenigo system transfered into your WordPress system.

**OAuth redirect URL**
This url should be set to identify the page that should handle the OAuth2 redirect result. In theory every page can do this, but after processing the user will be redirected again. So it is recommended to select a page here that can be rendered very fast, e.g. the wp-login page.

**URL After Login**
If you want the user to get redirected to a special URL after login you can define it here. If you don't insert an URL here the user will stay on the same page after login.

= Premium Content Section =

The plenigo plugin controls which article is paid content by the use of WordPress tags. So before you add mappings in this section you have to

1. Create WordPress tags that identify your payments.
2. Create a product within the plenigo product section. (This step is optional if you only want to sell single articles.)

**Premium Content Products**
The tag field offers auto completion for all existing WordPress tags. The product ids can be obtained by the plenigo backend product management. You can add multiple product ids to a single tag by separating them with a ','.
In case of the screenshot the tag payment is associated with a monthly subscription represented by its product id.

**Premium Content Categories**
The tag field offers auto completion for all existing WordPress tags. The category ids can be obtained by the plenigo backend product management. You can add multiple category ids to a single tag by separating them with a ','.
In case of the screenshot the tag buyButton is associated with a plenigo category that has a price of 2.99€. So every article that this tag is associated with will be buyable as a single product for the price of 2.99€

**Prevent Payment Tag**
If you add a tag here and add this tag to an article that is already marked with a tag that marks the article as paid content this decision will be reverted and the article will be free available again.

= Metered Views Section =

**Metered Views switch**
Metered views can be managed within the plenigo backend. If you disable metered views in the plenigo backend you should also disable them here to prevent some useless redirects that could happen to a user.

**Metered explain URL**
Metered views are often new to users. So you can provide an URL here where you explain the principle to them. This URL will automatically added to the metered view flag.

**Metered exemption tag**
With the tag defined here you can exclude articles from metered views so that the content is only available to paying customers. 

= Curtain Customization Section =

The curtain is "the heart" of your paywall. It will be shown to the user to motivate him paying. In this section you can modify the curtain. If you are an advanced user you can also overwrite the curtain template to get a completely customized curtain.

**Curtain Title**
The title of your curtain shown to the user.
 
**Curtain Message**
The message of your curtain shown to the user.

**Curtain Title (for memebers)**
This curtain title is shown to users that are already logged in but don't have paid yet.

**Curtain Message (for memebers)**
This curtain message is shown to users that are already logged in but don't have paid yet.

**Curtain Button Scheme**
This button scheme is used within the curtain if a product tag is added to an article.

**Curtain Button Scheme (Category tag)**
This button scheme is used within the curtain if a category tag is added to an article. If a product and a category tag is added to an article this scheme will be used.

**BUY Button Text**
Text that is shown on the buy button.

**LOGIN Button Text**
Text that is shown on the login button. This button can be used to provide existing users that already bought the content an easy way to log in.

**CUSTOM Button Text**
The custom button is a button that doesn't have logic implemented within. It only contains a link. This way you can redirect the user e.g. to a subscription selection page.
In this field you set the title for this button.

**CUSTOMER Button URL**
The URL the custom button should link to.

**CUSTOM Button Text (Category tag)**
In this field you set the title for the button within the category scheme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help =

To get help visit [help pages](https://developer.plenigo.com/plugins/wordpress/ "Wordpress plugin").

= Available Shortcodes =

**Checkout Button**
Creates a checkout button with optional title and optional css class.
If the product is bought, the button won't e shown and the contents
will be shown instead.
Note: You can use shortcodes and all formatting inside the button shortcode

[pl_checkout prod_id="{{PRODUCT ID}}" title="{{BUTTON TITLE}}"
class="{{CSS CLASS}}"]{{DISPLAY TEXT AFTER PURCHASE}}[/pl_checkout]

**Checkout Button (persistent)**
Same as pl_checkout but it will show the checkout button even if the
product is bought.

[pl_checkout_button prod_id="{{PRODUCT ID}}" title="{{BUTTON TITLE}}"
class="{{CSS CLASS}}"][/pl_checkout_button]

**Failed Payments button**
Same as pl_checkout_button but it will trigger the failed payments list
instead of checking out a particular product.

[pl_failed title="{{BUTTON TITLE}}" class="{{CSS CLASS}}"][/pl_failed]

**Subscription renewal button**
Same as pl_checkout but it will set the "Subscription Renew" flag for
this purchase.

[pl_renew prod_id="{{PRODUCT ID}}" title="{{BUTTON TITLE}}"
class="{{CSS CLASS}}"]{{DISPLAY TEXT AFTER PURCHASE}}[/pl_renew]

**Show content or Hide content based on purchases**
PRO TIP: What if you want to do a Welcome page that knows what the customer 
purchased and/or refer to other product that may be interested in?
No problem! Just create a page and use this neat shortcodes (superpowers if you
ask me) to show content if the product has been bought! We do the rocket science.

TO SHOW CONTENT: 

[pl_content_show prod_id="<Some plenigo Product ID>"]This content is shown if the 
Product has been bought. Thank your customer and encourage to 
buy other products[/pl_content_show]

TO HIDE CONTENT:

[pl_content_hide prod_id="<Some plenigo Product ID>"]We don't show and invitation 
to buy the product if it has been already purchased. Don't annoy your customers
[/pl_content_hide]

Ok, combine this with purchase buttons and the sky is the limit!

**Plenigo User Profile replacement**
To render a complete user profile with the current data from plenigo, just
create a nuew Page (i.e.: /PlenigoProfile ) and put the Shortcode below to 
render a nice (and customizable) user profile.

[pl_user_profile]Sorry the user is not logged in to plenigo[/pl_user_profile]

After that copy the URL of the newly cerated page and paste it in the Profile URL
setting at the Plenigo Login section.

**Separator vs More tag**
This hidden HTML tag will let plenigo know where the plugin should trim
the contents of the post and show the payment curtain. This allows to
manually slice the post without interferring with the "More..."
separator, native Wordpress tag.

<!-- {{PLENIGO_SEPARATOR}} -->
